# RDJ-ASCII-Art-Python
This project creates a stylized ASCII portrait of Robert Downey Jr using core Python programming concepts such as nested loops, conditional statements, and logical pattern design.  The project focuses on converting visual facial features into logical coordinate-based pattern printing without using any image processing libraries or converters.

Objective

Strengthen logical thinking

Practice nested loop pattern design

Understand coordinate-based drawing

Implement algorithmic ASCII art generation

🧠 Algorithm Used

Row-wise Conditional Pattern Mapping Algorithm

The program:

Creates a grid using rows and columns

Traverses each coordinate using nested loops

Uses conditional rules to decide which symbol to print

Different symbols represent different facial regions

🧩 Symbols Used
Symbol	Meaning
@	Hair / Dark regions
#	Strong shadows
%	Moustache / beard texture
*	Skin shading
.	Background / soft shading
+ = - :	Mid-tone detailing
⚙ Technologies Used
